            <p>This symposium addresses urgent concerns regarding control of digital space within and beyond the art and
                creative communities in Canadian and international contexts. It explores how artists and creators can
                contribute to a more ethical web. Some of the key topics of the symposium include:
                <br />• examples of activism against censorship and surveillance in the arts in the Canadian and
                international context
                <br />• examples of the current artist- and tech-involved initiatives of “taking back the web”
                <br />• and potential empowering alternatives in the digital sphere
                <br /><br />The symposium will explore three approaches as examples of artist- and tech-involved
                activism against two main and interconnected systems of oppression: artists as developers/co-developers
                of the Web’s Infrastructure; artistic “gestures” as activism against online censorship and surveillance;
                and storytelling— changing narratives through technology and science fiction.

                The question ‘can you hear me?’ was the title of an installation on the Swiss embassy in Berlin. The
                situation of surveillance through US- and British secret services have been inverted in this
                intervention. An open mesh network allowed users to send their messages anonymously - on the frequencies
                that are intercepted - to the secret services.

                <br /><br />The objections and debates of the one’s with a voice, mark the political field. Of course
                there are reasons to exclude troublemakers, to withdraw attention from trolls or to filter viruses. What
                is
                the protection of the regular operation mode and where does censorship start?

                <br /><br />With installations such as ‘Can you hear me?’ this situation was brought into the world wide
                spot light. Further there are marginalized voices that are overheard and excluded. Canalizations and
                categorizations of users and their options of expression have a profound impact. We will go on a search
                for traces, an
                archeology to sound the forms of exclusion. We can follow the cultural, economic and political turns.
                They coin the sociopolitical discourse and write themselves into our infrastructure, almost unnoticed.
                They can be traced back into our own hard- and software tools, as deep as into the kernels of our mobile
                phones.

                Thinking about the contents of the symposium, how can we create interesting ways of distributing the
                knowledge, experiences, and aspirations of our peers?
                Through a series of activities and methods, we will prototype and construct a (de)centralized network
                from the ways we communicate to the platforms that will layered over them.
                <br />Protocol: Could we speculate, and prototype, a new way of communicating with our peers?
                What are the boundaries for protocols like dat:// and ipfs?
                What are their strengths? Weaknesses?
                What values do they instantiate through their nodes and edges?
                <br />Platform: Could we speculate on a frame/mirror/window for us to interact with the network?
                If the browser is an interface for TCP/IP, what is an interface for our new protocols?
                What are the possible affordances we give to the user?
                Turing Complete User
                <br />Peers: Over time, what accumulates on the network? Speculate on how we will reflect on this protocol in
                the near-future
                In a time frame ~10 years into the future
                Reflect on the projects like Geocities and the vernacular web
                What will the network archivists of the future find through our collective protocols?

            <p><b>Dawn Walker</b> is a researcher and PhD student at the University of Toronto focused on participatory
                design tactics for building environmental civic technologies. She also imagines possibilities for
                grassroots
                and decentralized (environmental) data with EDGI and Data Together. A keen urban agriculturalist, Dawn
                would
                rather be in the garden.

            <p>This symposium addresses urgent concerns regarding control of digital space within and beyond the art and
                creative communities in Canadian and international contexts. It explores how artists and creators can
                contribute to a more ethical web. Some of the key topics of the symposium include:
                <br />• examples of activism against censorship and surveillance in the arts in the Canadian and
                international context
                <br />• examples of the current artist- and tech-involved initiatives of “taking back the web”
                <br />• and potential empowering alternatives in the digital sphere
                <br /><br />The symposium will explore three approaches as examples of artist- and tech-involved
                activism against two main and interconnected systems of oppression: artists as developers/co-developers
                of the Web’s Infrastructure; artistic “gestures” as activism against online censorship and surveillance;
                and storytelling— changing narratives through technology and science fiction.

                    Historically the domain of the state, the regulation of online speech has in large part been ceded
                    to corporations, driven by profit and accountable only to shareholders. Their revenue model—what
                    scholar Shoshona Zuboff calls "surveillance capitalism"—is reliant on closely tracking our behaviors
                    and desires while simultaneously restricting our expression to ensure desirability to advertisers.
                    What impact does this have on artists and culture? What are some of the ways that artists and others are pushing back?

                    The question ‘can you hear me?’ was the title of an installation on the Swiss embassy in Berlin. The
                    situation of surveillance through US- and British secret services have been inverted in this
                    intervention. An open mesh network allowed users to send their messages anonymously - on the
                    frequencies
                    that are intercepted - to the secret services.

                    <br /><br />The objections and debates of the one’s with a voice, mark the political field. Of
                    course
                    there are reasons to exclude troublemakers, to withdraw attention from trolls or to filter viruses.
                    What
                    is
                    the protection of the regular operation mode and where does censorship start?

                    <br /><br />With installations such as ‘Can you hear me?’ this situation was brought into the world
                    wide
                    spot light. Further there are marginalized voices that are overheard and excluded. Canalizations and
                    categorizations of users and their options of expression have a profound impact. We will go on a
                    search
                    for traces, an
                    archeology to sound the forms of exclusion. We can follow the cultural, economic and political
                    turns.
                    They coin the sociopolitical discourse and write themselves into our infrastructure, almost
                    unnoticed.
                    They can be traced back into our own hard- and software tools, as deep as into the kernels of our
                    mobile
                    phones.<br /><br />


                    <h5>Cobwebs that connect us: What is a social network?<br /><a href="#sarah-friend"><br />Sarah
                            Friend</a></h5>
                    How do we model social networks, and how do the ways we model social networks shape our
                    interactions within them? A web of trust is a cryptographic construct that attempts to capture
                    'trust' and use it as a form of identity - and we see it widely referenced, peer to peer
                    applications like CirclesUBI and Secure Scuttlebutt use a social graph inspired by a web of trust to
                    secure their network and shape interactions. In this talk, we'll discuss the web of trust as a
                    primitive and look at examples, from both the peer to peer and traditional web, to think through how
                    subtle differences in these network topologies effect the content and norms on the platform. We'll
                    also touch on the surveillance potential of social networks, and how even on an encrypted or
                    pseudonomous network, leaked metadata can often be used to identify users.

                    from the ways we communicate to the platforms that will layered over them.
                    <br />Protocol: Could we speculate, and prototype, a new way of communicating with our peers?
                    What are the boundaries for protocols like dat:// and ipfs?
                    What are their strengths? Weaknesses?
                    What values do they instantiate through their nodes and edges?
                    <br />Platform: Could we speculate on a frame/mirror/window for us to interact with the network?
                    If the browser is an interface for TCP/IP, what is an interface for our new protocols?
                    What are the possible affordances we give to the user?

                    <br />Peers: Over time, what accumulates on the network? Speculate on how we will reflect on this
                    protocol in
                    the near-future
                    In a time frame ~10 years into the future
                    Reflect on the projects like Geocities and the vernacular web

            <p><b>Connor Turland</b> is a software developer, educator, and facilitator, with a focus on collaborative,
                open
                source, and peer-to-peer technologies. He is especially concerned with finding ways to augment the
                conversations, and thus the thinking, that is necessary for humans to address the wicked challenges that
                face us collectively. This has led to much technical and social experimentation in tools and processes
                that
                restore agency, unlock higher potentials and collective intelligences. His work also hinges on the
                theory
                and practice of peer-to-peer as a basis for social interaction and non-hierarchical power structures.
